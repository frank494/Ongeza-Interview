Hello!
My Name Is Frank Burchard
This below is my short descrption on how to test and use my files, and Database

Use mysql-server to import database WHICH IS CALLED "ongeza_test",

You can use sublime text editor to check my source code or any editor supporing php files.

Then, my supporting folders are zipped in rar, so in order to use it its better to unzip and use it after downloaded.

Copy all files put in xamp-htdocs, you can create any folder in xampp and put all files and supporting folders and run into localhost, 

eg,localhost/ongeza/index.php,then press Enter.

I used xampp/php version 5.6.3.
